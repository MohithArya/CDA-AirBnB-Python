# CDA-AirBnB-python-proj
 AirBnB Exploratory python Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization on an AirBnB dataset. The goal is to gain insights into the data and identify key trends and relationships.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

This project explores the AirBnB dataset to understand various aspects of the listings, hosts, and locations.  It involves data loading, cleaning, and visualization to answer questions related to pricing, room types, location distribution, and other relevant factors.

## Steps <a name="steps"></a>

The project follows these main steps:

1.  **Import Libraries:** Loading necessary Python libraries.
2.  **Loading Datasets:** Reading the AirBnB dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Initial Exploration:** Examining the dataset's structure, columns, and basic statistics.
4.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and dealing with inconsistencies.
5.  **Data Analysis:** Performing calculations, aggregations, and visualizations to derive insights.

## Libraries Used <a name="libraries-used"></a>

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used is `datasets.csv` (Note:  If you got it from a specific source, mention that here).  It contains information about AirBnB listings, including details like:

* `id`: Listing ID
* `name`: Listing name
* `host_id`: Host ID
* `host_name`: Host name
* `neighbourhood_group`:  Borough
* `neighbourhood`:  Neighborhood
* `latitude`: Latitude
* `longitude`: Longitude
* `room_type`: Type of room
* `price`: Price
* (and other columns - list the important ones you used)

## Initial Exploration <a name="initial-exploration"></a>

The initial exploration involved:

* Displaying the first few rows of the data using `data.head()`
* Displaying the last few rows of the data using `data.tail()`
* Checking the dimensions of the data using `data.shape`
* Getting information about columns and data types using `data.info()`
* Describing the data statistically using `data.describe()`
* Checking the data types of each column using `data.dtypes`

## Data Cleaning <a name="data-cleaning"></a>

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

* Converted `id` and `host_id` to object types.
* Handled missing values in `[list columns with missing values]`.  (Specify how you handled them, e.g., filled with 0, mean, etc.)
* Corrected any incorrect data types.
* Removed or replaced any inconsistent values in `[list columns if applicable]`.

## Data Analysis and Visualization <a name="data-analysis-and-visualization"></a>

The data analysis involved:

* (List the specific analyses you performed)
* (e.g.,  Distribution of prices, average price by room type, etc.)

The following visualizations were used:

* (List the types of plots you created)
* (e.g., Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps)

## Key Findings <a name="key-findings"></a>

* (Summarize the most important insights from your analysis)
* (e.g.,  "The average price of an entire home/apt is significantly higher than that of a private room.")
* (e.g.,  "Manhattan has the highest number of listings.")
* (e.g.,  "There is a correlation between the number of reviews and the rating.")
